Start adding some features Derek mentioned?

Add ability to visualize by amenity type
	To do this, all I really need to just filter temp_merged by amenity type. 
	The question is where to visualize this? 
		Really just need to make an eventReactive and send in the proper argument eh?
		Right now it'll just visualize based on the baseline, as is scores, could later change access_score to another variable to make it visualize
			based on new scenario. 

	Wouldn't be a bad idea to add a function that makes a new base_map, b/c what I really need is an easy way to make maps with scores
		and not relative values. I think just quickly adding another function would be the easiest thing to do. Not really a big memory 
		footprint and it will prove helpful for updating the base_map if it needs to change. 

Add histograms
