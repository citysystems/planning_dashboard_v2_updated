Running to-do list:

Change legend label

Start adding some features Derek mentioned?

Add ability to visualize by amenity type
	Pretty sure it works. For some reason the filter function wasn't working. 

	Wouldn't be a bad idea to add a function that makes a new base_map, b/c what I really need is an easy way to make maps with scores
		and not relative values. I think just quickly adding another function would be the easiest thing to do. Not really a big memory 
		footprint and it will prove helpful for updating the base_map if it needs to change. 


Add histograms
	Scores by geography I think. 
	

What to do with the benchmark score?
	Change map to SD's or whatever above, below the benchmark. Could also add benchmark by type to the filter. 

Both map functions 
	Have to update which attributes are plotted in both functions. 
	Right now, I think I'll just change the basemap and go from there. 




Add recalc basemap button for new weights. 
Then could have two maps for filtering by layers. 


Today's plan 
	This will involve some pretty big changes so I'm going to go ahead and make a new branch to make sure I don't royally screw up the dashboard. 
	Implement the maps as Derek suggested


		When online app loads, 
			The first base map should probably already created	
 


		What needs to happen when "Go!" is pushed?

			For the basemap
				This one is currently working, scores change when weights change but not when parcel assignments change. 

	
			For the scenario map 
				Both weights and parcel assignments need to change, this shouldn't be a problem


	Eventually need to fix the summary statistics, this really shouldn't be a problem so I'll save it for later. 


	bg_scores also needs to be updated each time the weights change. 

	New branch created?
