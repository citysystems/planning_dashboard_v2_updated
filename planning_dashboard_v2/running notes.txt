Change legend label

Start adding some features Derek mentioned?

Add ability to visualize by amenity type
	Pretty sure it works. For some reason the filter function wasn't working. 

	Wouldn't be a bad idea to add a function that makes a new base_map, b/c what I really need is an easy way to make maps with scores
		and not relative values. I think just quickly adding another function would be the easiest thing to do. Not really a big memory 
		footprint and it will prove helpful for updating the base_map if it needs to change. 


Add histograms
	Scores by geography I think. 
	

What to do with the benchmark score?
	Change map to SD's or whatever above, below the benchmark. Could also add benchmark by type to the filter.
