Really what's next, 


Add sspz score totals,
Something is still messed up with the original data.shape I think.

Start adding some features Derek mentioned?

Add ability to visualize by amenity type
	To do this, all I really need to just filter temp_merged by amenity type. 
	The question is where to visualize this? 
		Could just make separate tab for now and add in later where appropriate

Add histograms
