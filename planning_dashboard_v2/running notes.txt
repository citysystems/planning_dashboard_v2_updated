Running to-do list:

Change legend label

Start adding some features Derek mentioned?

Add ability to visualize by amenity type
	Pretty sure it works. For some reason the filter function wasn't working. 

	Wouldn't be a bad idea to add a function that makes a new base_map, b/c what I really need is an easy way to make maps with scores
		and not relative values. I think just quickly adding another function would be the easiest thing to do. Not really a big memory 
		footprint and it will prove helpful for updating the base_map if it needs to change. 


Add histograms
	Scores by geography I think. 
	

What to do with the benchmark score?
	Change map to SD's or whatever above, below the benchmark. Could also add benchmark by type to the filter. 

Both map functions 
	Have to update which attributes are plotted in both functions. 
	Right now, I think I'll just change the basemap and go from there. 


Data's difference because the weights have now been update. 
	Basemap should probably not be static then. Need a way to incorporate new weights or proposals but keep the old base_map
	Could grab the proposals as the app starts up and save them. Might be best. 

Add recalc basemap button for new weights. 
Then could have two maps for filtering by layers. 


Actiona plan 
	Find a way to calculate a base_map that will use the as is proposals but be able to update when weights change
		Load original proposals and save before the app begins?

	bg_scores also needs to be updated	

	Add in normalized scores

	The only thing that's really off right now is the baseline scores. 



	Merged_data actually needs to be update with new weights?




Today's plan 
	This will involve some pretty big changes so I'm going to go ahead and make a new branch to make sure I don't royally screw up the dashboard. 
	Implement the maps as Derek suggested

		What needs to happen when the big button is pushed?
			Weights need to be updated on merged data and merged data parcels-> then a new base map needs to be created and a new scenario map 			needs to be created using the new weights and the most current parcel assignments.
