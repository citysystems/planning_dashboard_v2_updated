Start adding some features Derek mentioned?

Add ability to visualize by amenity type
	Pretty sure it works. For some reason the filter function wasn't working. 

	Wouldn't be a bad idea to add a function that makes a new base_map, b/c what I really need is an easy way to make maps with scores
		and not relative values. I think just quickly adding another function would be the easiest thing to do. Not really a big memory 
		footprint and it will prove helpful for updating the base_map if it needs to change. 

Add histograms
