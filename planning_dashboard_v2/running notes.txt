Really what's next, 

It would appear that the scenario function is working, now I just need to get it to create new maps. Then that's just about it I think. 
Now to see if this GitHub thing works. 


Problem is that I didn't update the one in the RData where I'm building the app, rather I didn't update it to the baseline column title. The numbers are correct. 

Need to fix the map, the legend is quite big. 


Add amenity info

bg_scores? just baseline scores. the baseline is actually the first scenario. Need to fix that real quick. Can probably do later. 
merged_data? for scenarios
merged_data_parcels? for scenarios

biking? just to get the spatial_id's required? 


functions - should probably actually upload these files. It'll be good to have them on GitHub for public scrutiny. 

score_calc
rank_fixer
type_splitter
weight_adder


What do I need for the map?

really just need data.shape sspz boundary?
